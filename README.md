# Preschool energy expenditure prediction models for wrist and hip worn accelerometers

## Predict energy expenditure on new data
free-living energy expenditure prediction models can be found in directory models/. Each file contains a
machine learning model for a specific accelerometer placement.
All models provide energy expenditure predictions in 10 second windows.
R script "predict on new data" provides examples to implement each model

## Manuscript data
The data used in the accompanying manuscript for each model is found in directory figur1/
